## Overview

This project is a modern and responsive website inspired by Dave Gray's [CSS Complete Project for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMN2Odm5ieA) tutorial. The goal is to create a fictional pizzeria website using HTML and CSS, focusing on responsive design and modern CSS practices.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the website looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern CSS**: Utilizes the latest CSS features such as variables, utility classes, and media queries.
- **Dark Mode**: A prefers-color-scheme dark mode in CSS to enhance user experience in different lighting conditions.
- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript features for dynamic user interactions.

## Lessons Learned

- Structuring HTML pages with semantic elements.
- Applying the BEM naming convention for CSS classes.
- Organizing CSS files for maintainability.
- Implementing a responsive layout with media queries.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main entry point of the website.
- `about.html`: Contains information about the company.
- `contact.html`: Contains contact information about the company.
- `hours.html`: Lists the operating hours of the company.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet containing all the CSS for the project.
- `script.js`: Contains JavaScript for interactive features.
